# MenuForTheoreticalAnimalFarmShop
Coded an animal shop in C++ with features to print/view the shopping cart and select animals based on attributes. Included a printed shopping cart receipt (csv file) when the user exits the program. Used objects and classes, arrays, files, loops, if/else statements, case statements, and error handling.
