# MenuForTheoreticalAnimalFarmShop
#### Coded an animal shop in C++ with features to print/view the shopping cart and select animals based on attributes. Included a printed shopping cart receipt (csv file) when the user exits the program. Used objects and classes, arrays, files, loops, if/else statements, case statements, and error handling.
<br> The goal of this programming assignment was to allow for a better understanding of classes, arrays with user defined data types, and inputting/outputting files containing data. This program had several inputs. The program user had to choose an option of the menu, and depending on the option selected, there could be more inputs for the age/weight range or type of animal they want outputted from Donna’s inventory of animals. Outputs included the animal information stored in the users shopping cart, Donna’s inventory, and the outputting of specific information based on criteria of the user’s choosing. Error handling was required in the program to ensure that the user did not choose an option outside the options of the menu. Additionally, there was error checking to see that the methods were appropriately executed. This was done through the usage of Boolean data types, which returned false if the animal information was not inserted or printed properly.
